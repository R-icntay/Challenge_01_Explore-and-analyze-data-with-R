# Challenge_01: Explore and Analyze data with R

## Module Source

[Explore and Analyze data with R]()

## Goals

Hello and welcome to this learning adventure! In this repo, you will find a Data Exploration Notebook. This is basically an autograding guided assessment notebook that will help you test your understanding in using R using R to explore and analyze data! We hope that you will find that R, is at its heart, a beautiful and elegant language for Data Science.

## Pre-Learning

This workshop allows learners to use the skills learnt in the module [Explore and Analyze Data with R]() to create their own regression models. As such, learners are encouraged to go through the module beforehand so as to be conversant with some of the concepts covered in this worksop.

## Prerequisites

____** Coming back to this**

## What you will learn

Let's say the Deaprtmnet of Transportation is considering the addition of a new airport. As the incredible data scientist you are, you have been requested to explore existing data. The results of your analysis might form the basis of a report or a machine learning mode.

In this challenge, you'll explore a real-world dataset containing flights data from the US Department of Transportation.

## Milestone 1: Clean the data

Rarely do we find data in the right form for analysis. As such, once you‚Äôve imported your data, a good place to start your analysis is by cleaning data to handle errors, missing values, and other issues. Is the data accurate and appropriate for your desired analysis? Cleaning data pays off in the long run and allows for easier and more accurate Exploratory Data Analysis.

In this section you will:

- Identify any null or missing data, and impute appropriate replacement values.

- Identify and eliminate any outliers in the DepDelay and ArrDelay columns.

## Milestone 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics (e.g distribution), often by visualizing and transforming data. 


In this section you will:

- View summary statistics for the numeric fields in the dataset.

- Determine the distribution of the DepDelay and ArrDelay columns.


### More EDA

The goal of EDA is to develop a better understanding of your data. More often than not, EDA will involve formulating some probing questions about your data, searching for answers by visualising and transforming data and finally using the understanding gained to refine questions, drop the questions entirely and/or generate new questions.

In this section, you will:

- Use statistics, aggregate functions, and visualizations to answer the following questions:

    - What are the average (mean) departure and arrival delays?

    - How do the carriers compare in terms of arrival delay performance?

    - Is there a noticable difference in arrival delays for different days of the week?

    - Which departure airport has the highest average departure delay?

    - Do late departures tend to result in longer arrival delays than on-time departures?

    - Which route (from origin airport to destination airport) has the most late arrivals?

    - Which route has the highest average arrival delay?

## Quiz

Test your knowledge with [a short quiz]()!

## Next steps

Congratulations on finishing this challenge üèÖ!

There are other Learn Modules around using [R for Data Science](...). In this module, we learnt how to clean data, visualize data and transform data to derive insights and knowledge. The next set of modules show you how to create regression models, create classification models and create clustering models. Be sure to check them out!

## Practice

In this workshop, you used already provided questions to guide your EDA. Sometimes this is not the case. Try generating questions of your own and answering them using the data visualisation and transformation skills you have acquire in this module. What new insights do you reveal?
